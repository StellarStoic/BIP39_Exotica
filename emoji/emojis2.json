In 2009, it appeared on a <a href=\"https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2009/09026r-emoji-proposed.pdf\">proposal</a> as one of many symbols available on Japanese phones recommended to be encoded into the Unicode Standard. In that proposal, the symbol was referred to as a &quot;recreational vehicle&quot; or RV. The original Japanese emojis look more like station wagons or SUVs than RVs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At various points, platforms including Google and Samsung showed this emoji as an RV, but ultimately the designs across platforms converged to a car that looks more like an SUV or station wagon.
